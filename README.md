# My final project for module 1

This is an exercise for the final exam of the module 1 of the developer's course in Adalab.

This is a responsive home page with different designs for mobile, tablet and desktop.

The main font-size of the page is 10px, because it was easier than 16px in order to do the math for the "rem" sizes.

The brand colors and main fonts are presented as variables to facilitate the developer's work.

The arrows in the white circles can send you to different parts of the page. The arrow on the buttom has an animation that makes it bounce up and down.

There is also a surprise! The "go" and "more reasons" buttons have a transition effect when you put your mouse on top of them! If you are on a tablet or mobile device you can just simply hold your finger on top of this buttoms to see the effect.

All the links bring you to the home page of Adalab.

I hope you enjoy my work!
